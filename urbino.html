                <p class="lead"> The summer of 2023 I was allowed the opportunity to study abroad in Urbino, Italy for a month. I teamed up with fellow classmates to create a webpage based on their stories they made with the townspeople of Urbino. My section was blank. I was able to ensure that my web page is responsive and mobile-friendly, providing a seamless user experience across various devices. I considered the needs and preferences of our website visitors for creating an engaging and intuitive user experience. I had never worked with Wordpress before but I was able to craft an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly website. The field of web development is constantly evolving, so staying up-to-date with the latest trends, technologies, and best practices is essential. I demonstrated a willingness to learn new skills and adapt to changes in the industry.
