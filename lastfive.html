                <p class="lead"> I was given the opportunity to be a publicist for a JMU run musical titled The Last Five Years. I worked with the director and what he envisioned for the show to create a playbill and a program. This project gave me the opportunity to showcase my visual design skills as well as further my knowledge with adobe indesign, illustrator, and photoshop. Selecting appropriate fonts and formatting text effectively is crucial for readability and conveying the tone of the production. I also curated instagram posts following the plays schedule. Coordinating the creation of the playbill involved managing deadlines, communicating with stakeholders such as the directors and producers and ensured that my final product met quality standards. Working on this project also gave me more insight in the printing process, editing, and copywriting.
